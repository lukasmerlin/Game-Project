# Game-Project
Megaman-like Game that I want to do for my first Ironhack Project

Current Problems and TODOs


Problems


Working with Spritesheets to make animations

Exporting/Importing my classes from external files for better organization

Chase function makes my the Enemy disappear when he reaches player.position.x

Game is being started when pressing ENTER but the “Press Enter to Start” Text is not visible

I have a library installed, which I', not using, can I delete all those files?


TODOS


Making Shots triggered by SPACE not mouse click

Making shots go only horizontally
