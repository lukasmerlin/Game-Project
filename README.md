# Game-Project
Megaman Clone that I want to do for my first Ironhack Project

Current Problems and TODOs:


Problems / Bugs


- Working with Spritesheets to make animations

- Exporting/Importing my classes from external files for better organization

- Chase function makes my the Enemy disappear when he reaches player.position.x

- Game is being started when pressing ENTER but the “Press Enter to Start” Text is not visible

- I have a PIXI installed, which I'm currently not using. Can I use some of it's functions without changing the overall structure of my Code?



TODOS


- Making Shots triggered by SPACE not mouse click

- Making shots go only horizontally
